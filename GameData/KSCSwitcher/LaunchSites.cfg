            description = The John F. Kerman Kerbal Space Center (KSC) is the KASA facility supporting Launch Complex 39 (LC-39), originally built for the Lunaris V, the largest and most powerful operational launch vehicle in history, for the Kerbollo manned Mün landing program proposed by President John F. Kerman. It was named in honor of Kerman by his successor, President Lyndon B. Kerman, shortly after his death in 1963. Since the end of the Kerbollo program in 1975, LC-39 has been used to launch every KASA human space flight, including Kerblab (1976), the Kerbollo-Koyuz Test Project (1977), and the Konstellation Program (1983-). Its Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) is the fourth-largest structure in the world by volume, and was the largest when completed in 1965. Located on the equator, it's the perfect place to begin any interplanetary spaceflight. It remains the busiest spaceport on Kerbin, launching the Hydra crew shuttle to the Krussian Mir stations as well as many other civilian spaceflights.

			description = Baikonur Kosmodrome (Космодро́м «Байкону́р») is the world's first and largest operational space launch facility by area. It is located in the desert steppes of Kerbalstan, about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Aral Sea, north of the Kyr Darya river, near Kyuratam railway station, at 90 meters above sea level. It is leased by the Kerbalstan government to Krussia (until 2215) and is managed jointly by the Krussian Federal Space Agency and the Krussian Aerospace Defence Forces. The shape of the area leased is an ellipse, measuring 90 kilometres (56 mi) east-west by 85 kilometres (53 mi) north-south, with the kosmodrome at the centre. It was originally built by the Koviet Union in the late 1950s as the base of operations for its space program. Under the current Krussian space program, Baikonur remains a busy spaceport, with numerous commercial, military and scientific missions being launched annually. All manned Krussian spaceflights are launched from Baikonur.
