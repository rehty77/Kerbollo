  description = Dinkelstein Kerman has become somewhat of a legend in the spacecraft industry, not least impressively because he vehemently claims to have been constructing and flying spaceships long before the first actual recorded instance of any such vehicle being assembled. This has led to some controversy and a lot of awkwardness between him and the Kerbin World-Firsts Record-Keeping Society. Be that as it may, Dinklestein's Emporium is still generally well regarded as a traditional, old-fashioned company, and their products are actually a lot less rusty than the company's owner.

Despite being such a young company however, Experimental Engineering has made a good start, quickly making a name for themselves in the industry, mainly thanks to their very educational and entertaining SC-9001 Science Jr. Experiment Kit. Despite valiant efforts from their representatives, however, they haven't quite been able to shake off the bad press that followed some leaked footage of an incident involving one of their units and a small critter that one of the scientists over at R&D used to keep as a pet. Some say the incident has made them extremely concerned with the safety of anything that approach their products. They've even rounded out the edges on their company logo.

Their flagship product, the FTX-2 Fuel Duct, is the final result of years of research and development and endless Kerbal-hours of effort to produce a device that will pump any amount of just about anything, no matter how cold, dense or volatile it is. The company enjoys a well-deserved reputation for such an important contribution to the industry, and most agree that these days, almost nobody remembers the embarrassment of their recall of the FTX-1 series, which had a small but highly problematic issue, that while it did pump fluids flawlessly, it pumped them in the wrong direction.

  description = What this small company lacks in experience and reputation, it makes up for in the sheer ambitiousness of their projects. Their first product was the very massive Mobile Processing Lab, which rumour has it was first developed as a mobile processing facility to secretly brew an experimental, possibly illegal fuel mixture, which was reportedly far more potent than the currently available propellants, and had a distinctive blue tint to it. Those rumours have never been proven however, and this mysterious blue propellant has yet to be seen by a reliable source. Despite their repeated attempts to be rid of these rumours, the company still suffers from a (probably undeserved) bad reputation. They try to offset this initial impression by offering much larger cash payoffs than other companies of similar size, which admittedly does very little to improve their current image.

Jeb's Junkyard has become one of Kerbin's most iconic names, becoming far more than just a beloved brand.

As a result, the Group acquired a reputation for being always in a hurry, and always strapped for cash. They still try their best to stay true to their original motivations as much as possible though, and will always be willing to support any ventures that push the currently established boundaries.

Their products reflect that pragmatic and arguably obsolete outlook, even in spite of the many newer companies that are coming up around them with alternatives that make space travel far more accessible than it was back in the "early days". Despite all this, the company has retained a small but loyal following of hardcore fans, who live by their vision of a very selective industry, populated only by the very best astronauts and engineers.

Be that as it may, Rockomax's gigantic presence in the industry cannot be gainsaid, and their products are actually pretty good value, even if they do lack that 'trendy' feel of the more up-scale rocketry brands. They are a massively large corporation, so don't expect them to cut you very special deals. They are already giving all their customers a bulk discount, plus their 'super-value' deals when using products from their partner brands. All this provided, of course, that you have your membership card with you when you go shopping at their warehouses.
