// The nodes inside STORY_DEF support string replacement tags (the bits inside [brackets]).

// The relationship between nodes and tags is not hard-coded internally, so any node can have any name, and reference any other node.
//
// All text segments inside nodes can be attributed context by its key (the bit left of the = sign), when using replacement tags, 
// you can pass in a search string to specify which keys to look for. A line may have multiple context keys, separated by commas.
// When replacing, the entries that match the most keys on the search will be used. Entries that match less tags than the most relevant entries are ruled out.
//
// Special Tags
//	[a] Replaced by 'a' or 'an' depending on the following word. (a Kerbal, an unsuspecting Kerbal)
//  [Agency] Replaced by the given agency that takes part in the story
//  [Topic] Replaced by the given topic for the story. This should always be a singular noun, like a place or a Kerbal, a part title, or an object of interest
//
// Special Context Keys
//	[:Subject] Used inside any standard tag. 'Subject' will be replaced by the supplied subject of the story (usually a celestial body name, or biome, or location)
